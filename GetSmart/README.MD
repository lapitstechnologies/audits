# Project Get Smart

## Introduction
Lapits Technologies was contacted by Dr. J.R. Lange, Serial Founder & Education Problem Solver, to review and perform a security audit of the smart contract. He is expert in higher education and online learning design with a 15-year track record of success.

He has founded GetSmart that aims to completely reverse student debt and fund education worldwide by tokenizing debt-relief through a smart contract that connects a tokenized lottery, cryptolending, and cryptoconnected NFT badges. This report presents the findings of the security assessment of our project's smart contracts.
