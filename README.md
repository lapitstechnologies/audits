# Audits

The following repository contains the security Audit reports conducted by our organizaion for our clients. The Smart Contracts have been tested over a given set of vulnerabilities and weaknesses

The Audits are conducted both manually, and through open-source tools

## Vulnerability Indicators

To assess the severity of exploits, one can refer to this table
 <table>
  <tr>
  <th>Indicator</th>
  <th>Severity</th>
  <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/lapitstechnologies/audits/blob/main/Images/image13.png" alt="Critical"></td>
    <td>Critical</td>
    <td>Critical vulnerabilities lead to major exploits, asset loss or data manipulations</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/lapitstechnologies/audits/blob/main/Images/image3.png" alt="Major"></td>
    <td>Major</td>
    <td>Major vulnerabilities have a significant impact on smart contract execution, e.g., public access to crucial functions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/lapitstechnologies/audits/blob/main/Images/image9.png" alt="Medium"></td>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>Medium-level vulnerabilities are important to fix. However, they cannot lead to asset loss or data manipulations</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/lapitstechnologies/audits/blob/main/Images/image8.png" alt="Minor"></td>
    <td>Minor</td>
    <td>Minor vulnerabilities are related to outdated or unused code snippets that cannot have a significant impact on execution</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/lapitstechnologies/audits/blob/main/Images/image4.png" alt="Informational"></td>
    <td>Informational</td>
    <td>nformational vulnerabilities do not pose a risk to security. These are merely improvements over the existing code</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
