## Vulnerability Indicators

To assess the severity of exploits, one can refer to this table
 <table>
  <tr>
  <th>Indicator</th>
  <th>Severity</th>
  <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/lapitstechnologies/audits/blob/main/Images/image13.png" alt="Critical"></td>
    <td>Critical</td>
    <td>Critical vulnerabilities lead to major exploits, asset loss or data manipulations</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/lapitstechnologies/audits/blob/main/Images/image3.png" alt="Major"></td>
    <td>Major</td>
    <td>Major vulnerabilities have a significant impact on smart contract execution, e.g., public access to crucial functions</td>

  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/lapitstechnologies/audits/blob/main/Images/image9.png" alt="Medium"></td>
    <td>Medium</td>
